# RMST Two Stages Clinical Trail Design
This is the storage of the start up project.  
Hope I could publish a paper based on this for my Ph.D. application.  

## Compare 3 methods:
· 2 stages log rank test design (Jung 2017)   
    Minjung Kwak & Sin-Ho Jung (2017) Optimal two-stage log-rank test for randomized phase II clinical trials, Journal of Biopharmaceutical Statistics, 27:4, 639-658, DOI: 10.1080/10543406.2016.1167073

· Simple RMST difference (Eaton 2020, Shan 2021)    
    Eaton A, Therneau T, Le-Rademacher J. Designing clinical trials with (restricted) mean survival time endpoint: Practical considerations. Clinical Trials. 2020;17(3):285-294. doi:10.1177/1740774520905563

· Special RMST rejection region (inspired by Litwin 2017)  
    Litwin S, Basickes S, Ross E A. Two‐sample binary phase 2 trials with low type I error and low sample size[J]. Statistics in medicine, 2017, 36(9): 1383-1394.

Basically, our method clinical trial design with RMST difference.  
I will specify it in detail if the final result is satisfying.  

No Bayesian method would be compared with I guess.

All codes are in R. Presented in notebook R kernel.
