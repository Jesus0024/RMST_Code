# RMST Two Stages Clinical Trail Design
This is the storage of the start up project.  
Hope I could publish a paper based on this for my Ph.D. application.  

## Compare 3 methods:
· 2 stages log rank test design (Jung 2017)  
· Simple RMST difference (Eaton 2020, Shan 2021)  
· Special RMST rejection region (inspired by Litwin 2017)  

Basically, our method clinical trial design with RMST difference.  
I will specify it in detail if the final result is satisfying.  

No Bayesian method would be compared with I guess.

All codes are in R. Presented in notebook R kernel.
